# eternity calculator ‚úñÔ∏è
eternity is a scientific calculator designed to compute various transcendental functions, integrating principles of 
design thinking, agile methodologies, and devops. 

## features üëæ
- **minimalistic ui**: a clean and intuitive interface that reduces distractions, allowing users to focus on their 
calculations effortlessly.
- **transcendental buttons**: access advanced functions like `arccos(x)`, `sinh(x)`, `standard deviation`, and more for 
complex mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic.
- **digit buttons**: easy-to-use buttons for numbers `0 - 9`, along with `+/-` for sign changes, `.` for decimal input, 
and a `,` (comma) for calculating complex mathematical operations that require multiple inputs.
- **operator buttons**: essential buttons for arithmetic operations `(+, -, x, /, %)` and functions like `sqrt` (square root), 
`1/x`, and a `=` to display calculated values.
- **special buttons**: features like `c` (clear), `ce` (clear entry), and `back` (delete last input) to help manage 
calculations efficiently.
- **radio buttons**: options to switch between degree and radian modes for trigonometric calculations, ensuring 
flexibility in usage.

## the process ‚úçüèΩ
the development of the calculator began with a tutorial from [javapoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-swing), providing 
a solid foundation in java-swing. after watching several tutorials, adam started developing the calculator‚Äôs ui and 
integrated java-swing to enhance the user experience, making it more stylish and user-friendly.

during development, he encountered bugs, including the inability to handle negative numbers and multiple inputs for 
transcendental functions. he and matthew then implemented solutions to allow negative values and created a system for 
processing lists of numbers.

with these issues resolved, adam focused on a dedicated class for transcendental functions, expanding the calculator‚Äôs 
capabilities. this iterative process has made the calculator more robust, accommodating both basic arithmetic and 
complex mathematical operations. 

overall, it has been a rewarding journey that enhanced all our programming skills. the project aimed to create 
transcendental functions from scratch, which are mathematical concepts widely used in the math world. from the start 
until now, all group members have contributed in one way or another.

## how to use ‚ùì
- **deviation functions**:
  - to calculate a standard deviation:
    - enter a list of numbers, each separated by a comma `,`, using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - click `st.dev` to obtain the result.
   
  - to calculate a mean absolute deviation:
    - enter a list of numbers, each separated by a comma `,`, using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - click `mad` to obtain the result.

- **power functions:** 
  - to calculate (x^y):
    - enter the base (x) using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - use a `,` (comma) to separate the arguments,
    - follow with the exponent (y) using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - the display should show `x,y`, where (x) is the base raised to the power of (y),
    - click `(x^y)` to obtain the result.

  - to calculate a(b^x):
    - enter a multiplier (a) using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - use a `,` (comma) to separate the numbers,
    - enter a base (b) using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - use a `,` (comma) to separate the numbers,
    - enter the exponent (x) using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - the display should show `a,b,x`, where (a) is a multiplier, and (b) is the base raised to the power of (x),
    - click `a(b^x)` to obtain the result.

- **trigonometric functions:**
  - to calculate arccos(x):
    - toggle between radian or degree mode first using the radio buttons,
    - enter the number you want to calculate using the digit buttons `0 - 9` (the number must be between -1 and 1),
    - click `arccos(x)` for the result.
    - ```
      example: 0.5 -> arccos(x)
      result: 60¬∞ (if in degree mode) or 1.0472 (if in radian mode).
      ```

  - to calculate sinh(x):
    - enter the number you want to calculate using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - click `sinh(x)` for the result.

- **logarithm functions:**
  - to calculate the logarithm with base 10:
    - enter the desired number using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - click `log_b(x)` to obtain the result.
    
  - to use euler‚Äôs number (e) as the base:
    - input the number using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - click `ln(x)` for the result.
    
  - for logarithms with a base other than 10 or e:
    - enter a number (x) using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - use a `,` (comma) to separate the arguments,
    - follow with the base (b) using the digit buttons `0 - 9`,
    - the display should show `x,b`, where `x` is the argument and `b` is the base,
    - click `log_b(x)` to obtain the result.
