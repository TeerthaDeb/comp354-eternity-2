# eternity calculator ‚úñÔ∏è
eternity is a scientific calculator designed to compute various transcendental functions, integrating principles of design thinking, agile methodologies, and devops. 

## features üëæ
- **minimalistic ui**: a clean and intuitive interface that reduces distractions, allowing users to focus on their calculations effortlessly.
- **transcendental buttons**: access advanced functions like `arccos(x)`, `sinh(x)`, `standard deviation`, and more for complex mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic.
- **digit buttons**: easy-to-use buttons for numbers `0 - 9`, along with `+/-` for sign changes, `.` for decimal input, and a `,` (comma) for calculating complex mathematical operations that require multiple inputs.
- **operator buttons**: essential buttons for arithmetic operations `(+, -, x, /, %)` and functions like `sqrt` (square root), `1/x`, and a `=` to display calculated values.
- **special buttons**: features like `c` (clear), `ce` (clear entry), and `back` (delete last input) to help manage calculations efficiently.
- **radio buttons**: options to switch between degree and radian modes for trigonometric calculations, ensuring flexibility in usage.
